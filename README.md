# Takeaway Challenge - Bernard Leanse

## Domain Model

I started by making a diagram on draw.io of how this program will be structured. 
I used draw.io to create an app interface object which was dependent on a menu class and a dish class
It was also dependent on a TwilioSender class which would send text confirmation.

# Coding it!

I started by test driving a dish class followed by a menu class. The functionality was simple 
but getting the tests written I found more difficult, trying to foucs on keeping the tests behavior oriented.
